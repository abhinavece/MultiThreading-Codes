/**
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch} Java class to synchronize your
 * threadsâ€™ activities. <br>
 * <br>
 * Source:
 * <em>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17827022/what-is-countdown-latch-in-java-multithreading</em><br>
 *
 * Any thread, usually main thread of application, which calls
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch#await()} will wait until count
 * reaches zero or its interrupted by another thread. All other thread are
 * required to do count down by calling
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch#countDown()} once they are
 * completed or ready. <br>
 * 
 * 
 * As soon as count reaches zero, Thread awaiting starts running. One of the
 * disadvantage of {@link java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch} is that it's not
 * reusable once the count reaches to zero you can not use
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch} any more. <br>
 * <br>
 * 
 * 
 * Use {@link java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch} when one thread, like main
 * thread, require to wait for one or more threads to complete, before it can
 * start processing. <br>
 * <br>
 * 
 * Classical example of using {@link java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch} in
 * Java is any server side core Java application which uses services
 * architecture, where multiple services are provided by multiple threads and
 * application can not start processing until all services have started
 * successfully. <br>
